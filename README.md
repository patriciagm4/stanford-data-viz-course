This visualization portfolio was created for the Stanford course CME 151: Introduction to Data Visualization. The portfolio development included tools and techniques for formatting data, creating 2D and 3D as well as interactive visualizations with various JavaScript libraries, wrapped in a web application using Python Flask and Heroku frameworks. These tools demonstrate the potential for web-based visualizations as a useful way to communicate science for decision-making.
